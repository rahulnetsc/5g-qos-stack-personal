# 5g-qos-stack — working notes for Claude

Read `README.md` first; it is the branch charter and is authoritative wherever
it conflicts with `docs/p5g-sim-plan.md`. This file is only the things that
get re-explained every session.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync                                          # set up env (first time)
uv run pytest sim/tests -q                       # full suite (~45s, must stay green)
uv run pytest sim/tests/test_scorecard.py -q     # one file
uv run python scripts/regression_corpus.py --check   # numeric drift vs snapshot
uv run python scripts/regression_corpus.py --capture # re-baseline (see rules below)
uv run python scripts/scheduler_study.py         # the published studies 1-3
```

Everything runs under `uv run`. There is no `pip install -e .` step and no
bare `python` invocation that works.

## Project layout

- `sim/` — simulator: `driver.py` (slot loop), `channel.py`, `buffer.py`,
  `traffic.py`, `resource.py`, `ue_lcp.py`, `metrics.py`.
- `sim/power.py` — WP1. Tx power headroom (`ph_factor`, `shrink_to_power_budget`).
  Dormant: not imported by `driver.py` or any scheduler. PHR is inert on
  hardware (README §4).
- `sim/bsr.py` — WP3. UL BSR realism: per-LCG quantisation (TS 38.321
  Tables 6.1.3.1-1/-2), short-BSR aliasing, event-triggering (regular/
  periodic/retx), and the `sched_ul_bytes` crumb-collapse gate.
  `sim/buffer.py` is purely the true-backlog store now — it does not model
  BSR delay/loss/quantisation at all; `BsrModel` is the only writer of a
  UL flow's `bytes_reported`/`estimated_ul_buffer_per_lcg`.
- `sim/run_record.py`, `sim/scorecard.py` — WP0 (+ WP3 for M02). The scoring
  layer. `scorecard.py` must not import `sim/driver.py` or `sim/config.py`; it
  consumes `RunRecord` only, so it can score records from any producer.
- `config/metric_panel.yml` — the pre-registered metric panel. See rules below.
- `scheduler/` — `two_tier.py`, `tier1.py`, `link.py`, `flow.py`.
  `flow.py::FlowConfig.lcg` self-resolves from 5QI via `__post_init__` — see
  invariants below.
- `sim/baselines/` — PF, RoundRobin, Gradient. The Phase 1 comparison arms.
- `oai-branches/{two-tier,reservation}/` — read-only verified OAI C source.
  Ground truth for Phase 2. Same filenames in both dirs with *different*
  contents; never merge or dedupe them. `two-tier/nr_mac_common.c` and
  `nr_ue_scheduler.c` (WP3) are vendored from a *different* upstream
  directory (`NR_MAC_COMMON`/`NR_MAC_UE`, not `NR_MAC_gNB`) than the rest —
  see `oai-branches/README.md` for per-file commit provenance.
- `regression/baseline_studies_1_3.json` — 22-record numeric snapshot.
- `docs/` — planning docs. `p5g-sim-plan.md` §9 has the per-WP technical spec.

## Non-obvious invariants

These are the ones where the "helpful" fix is the wrong one.

**Reproduce measured behavior, not documented intent.** Where the OAI C
source's comment disagrees with its code, the *code* is what shipped and
what produced the hardware numbers. Known case: reservation's post-grant
deficit drain comments "distribute tb_size drain proportionally across
active LCGs" and then credits the full `tb_size` to every active LCG
independently. Port the full-credit behavior. Do not make it proportional.
If you find another comment/code mismatch, flag it and ask — do not
reconcile it silently in either direction.

**Do not add SPS / Configured Grant to the schedulers.** `main`'s
`scheduler/two_tier.py` has it (`_SPSReservation`, `_allocate_sps`); the real
hardware scheduler defers SPS to a Phase 2 that was never built. The Python
model must match the deployed scheduler, not exceed it.

**The gNB cannot see a UE's intra-TB per-flow split.** Only aggregate
per-LCG BSR. `main` has `_shadow_lcp_split` / `_occupancy_split` /
`_mac_lcp_fill` doing this anyway; it is a known modeling error, not a
pattern to extend. When adding any mechanism, ask which network element
would actually learn this and how.

**Tier-1 period is 0.1 s, not the 1.0 s in `ia_p5g_scheduler.h`'s doc
comment.** The `.c` file hoists the macro; the gNB startup banner confirms
100 ms is what ran.

**`min_rb` is a static gNB config constant (`nrmac->min_grant_prb`), not
derived from SNR or payload.** Don't compute it from channel quality —
that's a different, sim-only quantity (`scheduler/link.py::snr_to_prb_floor`,
WP1). See README §7 for the full distinction; WP2's reservation follower
budget needs the real one.

**When porting an OAI C function, check every call site before collapsing
or defaulting a parameter.** WP1 almost shipped `compute_ph_factor`'s
`include_bw` as always-`true` after checking 3 of its 6 call sites; the
other 3 (`phr_txpower_calc`) pass `false`. Also mirror `AssertFatal`
preconditions as raises rather than dropping them (silently wrong beats
loudly wrong), and mirror `roundf()` (half-away-from-zero) explicitly
instead of Python's `round()` (half-to-even) — they disagree at exact
`.5`. `sim/power.py` is the worked example for all three.

**One fidelity change per commit.** Land it, run the full suite, run
`regression_corpus.py --check`, and record which numbers moved and why.
Bundling two changes makes the deltas uninterpretable, which is the whole
point of the corpus.

**A UL flow's `bytes_reported` deadlocks without a cold-start/re-arm probe
— this is load-bearing, not a hack to remove.** Every scheduler's UL
eligibility gate reads `bytes_reported > 0`, but only a grant updates it
(`sim/bsr.py::BsrModel.on_ul_grant`), and a grant requires the gate to
already be open. This isn't just a t=0 case: it recurs every time a flow's
real backlog goes from empty back to non-empty, which is most UL traffic
in this repo. `BsrModel.broadcast()`'s probe (fires when the gated value
is 0 **and** a BSR is `pending`) stands in for the Scheduling Request real
5G uses here — WP4's job, not WP3's. See README §8 for the full writeup;
WP4 should treat properly retiring this stopgap as an acceptance
criterion, not optional cleanup. Don't "simplify" it away — doing so
silently breaks UL throughput on every scenario in the repo (verified:
removing it drops a 30-UE sensor scenario from ~99% to ~0.2% delivery).

**`sim/bsr.py`'s per-LCG array is frozen between BSRs — do not drain it on
a grant, and do not resync it with the scalar `estimated_ul_buffer`.**
Faithful to the OAI ground truth (README §7): a grant only drains a
separate `ul_lcg_deficit_bytes`-style counter in the real C, never
`estimated_ul_buffer_per_lcg` itself; the scalar *is* decremented on real
data receipt but the per-LCG array is not, so the two legitimately desync
between BSRs. Both are deliberate, not oversights.

**BSR quantisation tables come from vendored OAI source, not the 3GPP
spec text or memory.** `sim/bsr.py`'s `NR_SHORT_BSR_TABLE`/
`NR_LONG_BSR_TABLE` are transcribed from `oai-branches/two-tier/
nr_mac_common.c` (see that file's own citation for the exact commit) and
checked byte-for-byte against it by `sim/tests/test_bsr.py` on every test
run. If a future change touches these tables, re-verify against that
vendored file, not by re-deriving from the spec — 38.321 tabulates rather
than publishing a generating formula, so "reconstructing" a table by
formula is exactly the same silent-wrongness risk as recalling it from
memory.

## Rules for the WP0 machinery

**`config/metric_panel.yml` is pre-registered.** Adding a metric is fine.
Removing one, or changing a definition to something that happens to separate
two schedulers better, defeats the multiplicity guard. Every metric keeps a
`status` of `ok` / `proxy` / `pending` and a `requires` naming the WP that
promotes it — a WP that claimed to unlock a metric but left its status
unchanged is a finding, not a detail.

**A `pending` metric emits a row with `value=None` and a reason.** Never
omit it. An omitted row is indistinguishable from a forgotten one.

**Do not `--capture` a new regression baseline to make a diff go away.**
Re-baseline only when a change is *intended* to move the numbers, and say so
in the commit message. `--check` failing is information.

**Check `requires:` in the file, not from memory, before assuming which WP
gates a metric.** M04's `requires` has always named WP7 (discrete message
model) + `record_timeseries=True`, never WP3 — a plausible-sounding
assumption that WP3 gates it (it's BSR-adjacent) is wrong. As of WP3
landing: M01 stays `proxy` (still needs WP7), M02 flipped to `ok` (WP3's
third commit), M04 unchanged.

## Known issues (flagged deliberately, do not fix as a drive-by)

- `sim/metrics.py::record_hol_delay` drops zero-delay samples, biasing every
  latency percentile pessimistic at low load. Left as-is so the regression
  baseline matches the published numbers. Fixing it is its own commit with
  its own regression diff.
- `average_agg_level` is hardcoded to 4 in the OAI DL scheduler
  (`// TODO find a better estimation`). Decide deliberately whether the sim
  models it fixed or SNR-dependent.
- WP3's measured crumb fraction (grants ≤150 bytes) on
  `factory_robots_scenario` @ 1.0× with TwoTier is **0.09%**, against the
  hardware measurement's ~48-52% the charter asks to reproduce within a
  factor of two — the crumbs that do occur average 79 bytes (matches
  hardware's 72-107 byte range), only the *frequency* is off. Landed as-is
  per user decision (README §8) rather than chased; plausibly scenario- or
  timer-cadence-dependent, not necessarily a modeling bug. Revisit with
  WP9's wider parameter sweep before deciding it's a real gap.
- H5 (`p5g-sim-plan.md` line 338, two-tier degrades as flows-per-LCG
  grows) is not demonstrable on any current scenario — WP3's default 5QI→
  LCG mapping deliberately separates QoS classes into different LCGs, so
  no scenario's multi-UL-flow UEs share one. Needs a small follow-up
  scenario (README §8) before H5 can be tested in Phase 3.

## Style

- Comments explain *why*, especially why something deviates from the obvious.
  A comment saying what the line does is noise.
- Docstrings on new modules state what the module is for and what it must not
  depend on.
- No new runtime dependencies. Current set: numpy, cvxpy, matplotlib, pyyaml,
  scipy (+ solvers). Stdlib `csv`/`json` over pandas.
- Type hints on new public functions.
